## Overview:
The project utilize Python and its library to perform Risk Analytics on loan application data and identify the bad loan applicants which are delayed/not paid.

- Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing information about applicant such as loan type, gender, income, car/real estate ownership etc. This dataset serves as foundation for risk analysis.

- Data Wrangling: Conduct data wrangling to transform raw data into a more adaptable form. This involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, checking data types and ensuring data integrity.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform a thorough analysis on the dataset to understand variable relationships. Utilize feature engineering, statistical analysis and visualization to gain insights.

## Final Insights:

- Education Impact: Lower education correlates with higher loan default chances, a key driver in defaults.
Occupation Concerns: Labourers & Sales staff show high applicant counts and significant loan default rates. Drivers also exhibit alarming counts and default percentage.

- Applicants on Maternity leave has a 40% loan default rate and Unemployed applicants exhibit 35% default rate.

- Income Dependency: Lower income range has the highest loan default percentage. As income increases the probability of loan default decreases.

- Family Status: Among different family status, married individuals show the highest chances of loan default.

- Annuity Amount Impact: Applicants with lower annuity amount are slightly more likely to default loans.

- Age Factor: Young applicants have a higher chances of loan default.

- Gender Disparity: Men exhibit higher loan default rates compared to women.

## Recommendation:

- Exercise caution when approving loans for applicants with lower education levels, a major factor in defaults.

- Devise policies to address defaults in categories like Labourers, Low-income range etc. which logically link to lower education. Addressing education levels may have a chain effect, significantly improving loan repayments.
